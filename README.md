# A project of a simple radar consisting of an ultrasonic distance sensor HC-SR04 and a servo to rotate it.

The project comprises a servo with variable speed controlled by STM32 timers, an ultrasonic distance sensor, and a screen that graphically displays the distance to objects. The communication with the screen utilizes SPI and is built upon my other project, SensorGraph.
